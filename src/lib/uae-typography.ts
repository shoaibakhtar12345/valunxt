/**
 * The UAE typography opt-ins.
 *
 * Two sheets, two helpers, one mechanism. Each helper does two things that only
 * make sense together:
 *
 *   1. appends its stylesheet to the page's `site_css`, which HeadAssets emits
 *      LAST — after the theme, Elementor, the brand sheet and any per-page
 *      sheet, which is what lets it win;
 *   2. adds its class to the body class, which is the hook every selector in
 *      that file is scoped to.
 *
 * Miss (1) and nothing loads. Miss (2) and it loads and matches nothing. Doing
 * both from one function is the point.
 *
 * THE TWO SHEETS, and why they are two:
 *
 *   withUaeFace   valunxt-uae-face.css   Sanomat Sans, and only the family.
 *                                        EVERY page under /en-ae/, including the
 *                                        404 fallback and the real estate module.
 *   withUaeType   valunxt-uae-type.css   The type scale — sizes, weights, line
 *                                        heights. The market home page and the
 *                                        services section, as it always was.
 *                                        Loads the face too, because a scale
 *                                        with no face would be theme fonts at
 *                                        UAE sizes, which nobody asked for.
 *
 * They were one sheet until 20260910. The client then asked for the whole
 * market to change face — About, Contact, Blogs, Industries and the rest — with
 * every size, weight and line height left exactly as it was. Widening the one
 * sheet would have put those pages on the scale as well; splitting the family
 * out is what lets the face travel alone. See lib/pages.ts for where each is
 * applied.
 *
 * The append order matters. `site_css` is emitted in array order, and these
 * sheets have to come after a page's own — /accounting-bookkeeping/ carries
 * one, and a family declared there would otherwise outlive this.
