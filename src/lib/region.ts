 *     /en-ae/…   UAE
 *
 * Only the pages that genuinely differ per market need their own file. The
 * home page does: app/[region]/page.tsx picks the India or UAE home so each
 * market gets its own hero, copy and imagery. Everything else is a single
 * shared page rendered under the region segment, so REGION still says "en-ae"
