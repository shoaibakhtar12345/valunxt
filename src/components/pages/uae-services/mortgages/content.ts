/**
 * What /en-ae/services/mortgages-services/ says.
 *
 * THE COPY IS THE CLIENT'S page document (20260911), word for word, on the
 * service template, under the same two rules as the home page: nothing added
 * to the document or dropped from it, and no em dashes anywhere on the UAE
 * pages. The document gives this page three proof points where the others
 * have four; the list takes any count. Every tab's button is the intro's
 * call, so the tabs name none of their own and take it by default.
 *
 * SUB-SERVICE SLUGS resolve through vxnServices('en-ae'), so every slug below
 * exists in that registry and the strip cannot point at a 404. The card names
 * are the document's ("Mortgage Pre-Approval", "Non-Resident Mortgages"); the
 * registry still carries the unhyphenated forms for the menu and the
 * breadcrumbs until those pages' documents arrive.
