/**
 * What /en-ae/services/valuation-and-advisory/ says.
 *
 * THE COPY IS THE CLIENT'S page document (20260911), word for word, on the
 * service template, under the same two rules as the home page: nothing added
 * to the document or dropped from it, and no em dashes anywhere on the UAE
 * pages. The figures (48+ years, 200Bn+ USD, 11K+ clients, award-winning)
 * are the client's own claims about Reliant Surveyors, the group's valuation
 * firm, which is why that name appears where it does.
 *
 * ONE SLOT THE DOCUMENT LEAVES EMPTY: the intro band's two buttons, which the
 * other service documents give and this one does not. The band keeps them,
 * labelled with the document's own closing call and the secondary every other
 * page carries, because the intro's primary is also where the strip's link
 * and any tab without a button of its own lead. Marked in the report.
 *
 * SUB-SERVICE SLUGS resolve through vxnServices('en-ae'), so every slug below
 * exists in that registry and the strip cannot point at a 404.
