/**
 * The UAE service template's motion layer.
 *
 * WORKS BY SELECTOR, NOT BY WRAPPER. The alternative is a <Reveal> around every
 * block, which means the body file carries animation concerns in forty places
 * and anything added later has to remember to opt in. This reads a table and
 * animates whatever matches.
 *
 * THE SAFETY RULE. Reveal animations are the standard way to ship an invisible
 * page: the stylesheet sets opacity 0, the observer never fires, and the content
 * is simply gone. So the stylesheet's default is VISIBLE, and the hidden state
 * exists only under `[data-anim='pending']` — an attribute this file sets. If
 * the bundle fails to load, is blocked, or throws, every section renders
 * normally. Two further guards: anything already on screen when this runs is
 * revealed rather than left waiting for an intersection that will not come, and
 * a timeout sweeps the whole page after four seconds whatever the observer did.
 *
 * THE PLATES. `.at-zoom` media is driven by one rAF loop over whatever is
 * currently in view — not a scroll listener per element — and it writes two
 * custom properties the stylesheet turns into a transform:
 *
 *   --at-z   scale. 1 mid-screen, lifting to 1.12 at either end of the
 *            element's travel: a zoom-out as it arrives, back in as it leaves.
 *   --at-p   drift, -1..1 across the same travel. The stylesheet multiplies it
 *            into a translate so a plate moves against the scroll while the
 *            copy over it stays put. Parallax and zoom share one loop and one
 *            measurement, because they are the same measurement.
 *
 * Both are written as properties rather than as a transform string so the
 * stylesheet keeps control of the curve, the distance and the axis — a plate
 * behind a full-bleed banner wants a different throw from one inside a card.
 *
 * COST. One IntersectionObserver for the reveals, one for the zoom's in-view
 * set, one rAF loop that only runs while something is in view and stops itself
 * when nothing is. Revealed elements are unobserved.
