/**
 * What a UAE service page says — the content behind ServiceTemplateBody.
 *
 * One object per service, one component for all six. Every string, link and
 * photograph that differs between /services/accounting-tax-services/ and
 * /services/mortgages-services/ is a field here; nothing about the layout is.
 *
 * PHOTOGRAPHS ARE CANDIDATE LISTS, in the house convention: a purpose-shot
 * filename first, an existing library photograph behind it, so commissioning a
 * proper shot is a drop into uploads/services/ and no code change. rimgFirst()
 * takes the first that exists, and a market can override any of them under
 * uploads/regions/<slug>/.
 *
 * FIGURES ARE NEVER OUTCOMES. The copy in these modules states what a service
 * does and who it is for; it does not promise what it will achieve. That is
 * the line the rest of the UAE content already holds (see ../content.ts) and a
 * regulated advisory firm's service page has to hold it too.
