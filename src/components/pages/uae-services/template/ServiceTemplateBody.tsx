/**
 * The UAE service page template — /en-ae/services/<service>/, all six.
 *
 * ONE COMPONENT, SIX CONTENT MODULES. This began as the Accounting & Tax page,
 * written as its own body because the client's fifteen-section document did
 * not fit the shared five-section template. The client then asked for the
 * other five services to take the same page — every section, every plate, the
 * same footer — with only the words changed. So the body became this: a
 * component that reads a ServiceTemplateContent (see ./types.ts) and renders
 * the page, and a content module per service under ../<service>/content.ts.
 * The `at-` class prefix is that history; it is the template's prefix now.
 *
 * SECTION ORDER IS FROM THE SOURCE DOCUMENT, not chosen here: hero, the
 * proposition, then the sub-service strip — "the commercial centre of the
 * page" — the chooser, the banner, the related services and the close. "Do
 * not allow generic education to push the services down the page."
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE VISUAL SYSTEM
 *
 * 1. ARTWORK, NOT COLOUR, CARRIES THE DARK BANDS. Every plate is on .at-zoom,
 *    so it scales and drifts against the scroll — see Motion.tsx. A plate that
 *    moves is what stops a full-bleed band reading as a rectangle of paint.
 *
 * 2. ONE SPACING SCALE. --pad, --gap, --cardpad and --radius are declared once
 *    on .at-root and every section reads them, so no two grids can drift apart
 *    and the rhythm down the page is even at all three breakpoints.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * HOVER MOVES NOTHING
 *
 * Every hover state here changes colour, light or coverage — never position.
 * There is no `transform` under any `:hover` rule in this file, deliberately:
 * a strip of eight panels that each jump 5px on approach is restless to read,
 * and on a trackpad it flickers as the pointer crosses a gap. What replaced it:
 *
 *   the texture      a plate already inside the card, fading up from 0
 *   the arrow        the link's own `gap` opens, so the glyph travels without
 *                    a transform on anything
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * MOTION, and the rule that matters most
 *
 *   hover        CSS only. Never gated on JavaScript.
 *   reveal       Motion.tsx, by selector. The stylesheet's default is VISIBLE;
 *                the hidden state exists only under [data-anim='pending'],
 *                which that file sets — so a failed bundle cannot produce a
 *                blank page. See its header for the rest of the guards.
 *   plates       .at-zoom, also Motion.tsx: one rAF loop writing --at-z and
 *                --at-p, which this stylesheet turns into scale and drift.
 *
 * TYPE AND !IMPORTANT. The Elementor kit styles bare h2/h3/p at a specificity
 * these classes cannot reach on their own, which is why every type declaration
 * below is marked. Same reason ServicePageBody marks its own.
 *
 * THE STYLESHEET IS A TEMPLATE LITERAL. A backtick anywhere inside it — in a
 * comment quoting a property, say — ends the string and the build fails with
 * "Expected a semicolon". Properties in the comments below are written bare
 * for that reason.

/**
 * The Elementor element ids of the "Find the Right Solution" block, per tab.
 *
 * THE BLOCK IS THE HOME PAGE'S SECTION, and post-17.css styles it BY ID:
 * `.elementor-17 .elementor-element.elementor-element-b39c796 { --width: 370px }`
 * and so on for every container and heading in it. The markup below therefore
 * has to carry these exact ids to be styled at all, which is why they are a
 * table rather than something generated.
 *
 * WHY IT CAN BE A LOOP. Read across the three tabs, the rules are the same
 * rule three times: every item block is flex, zero gap, 370px wide; every
 * name carries the accent_1 left rule and every line under it the accent_7
 * one. The ids differ, the styling does not. So a tab with fewer items than
 * ids simply renders fewer, and one with more than the table holds reuses its
 * last set — a duplicate data-id is not a DOM id and nothing reads it. The
 * home page had three items in the third tab (a55c103); its heading ids were
 * never captured, so that slot reuses the second item's.
 *
 * The first tab's right-hand pane wraps its blur layers in template 7162, the
 * other two carry them inline. Both shapes are kept as captured.

   HERO — a photograph, and the copy at its foot.

   Built to the accounting-bookkeeping sub-page's banner on client feedback,
   and to the pixel: the same plate treatment, the same two scrims, the same
   four-layer blur rising out of the bottom edge, the same crumb, title and
   lede at the same sizes. The blue ramp and the masked sculpture this band
   carried before are gone with it.

   THE PLATE is a full-bleed photograph on .at-zoom, so Motion.tsx drifts and
   scales it against the scroll the way it does every other plate here; the
   16px throw is the sub-page's. Two scrims in one paint: a wash from the left
   so the copy has a dark ground whatever the photograph is doing under it,
   and a lift from the foot so the blur has something to dissolve into.

   THE BLUR FROM THE BOTTOM is four stacked backdrop-filters, each masked to
   start lower than the one before, so the strength the reader sees ramps from
   nothing to 22px at the bottom edge — a single masked backdrop-filter can
   only fade one strength in and out. It sits UNDER the copy in the z-order,
   and the band's bottom padding keeps the copy clear of it, so the text is
   never the thing being blurred. The wash over it is what hands the band to
   the white section beneath instead of a hard edge; a gradient rather than a
   solid, so a browser without backdrop-filter still gets a soft foot.

   The band is sized by min-height and its own padding, so the 40px section
   rule the rest of the page runs on would only add a seam here. The padding
   is marked because .at-root section is (0,1,1) and this is (0,1,0).

   THE INTRO BAND — the proposition, stated.

   A head-and-lede row over a two-rail body: the statement on the left and its
   description on the right, then the commercial points as a ruled list on the
   left with the photograph filling the right.

   THE HEAD ROW IS TWO COLUMNS, NOT A CENTRED BLOCK — on client feedback. It
   was a 760px centred stack, heading over paragraph. It is now the heading in
   the left column and the paragraph in the right, bottom-aligned so the
   paragraph's last line sits on the heading's baseline row and the two read
   as one line across the band. The paragraph is pushed to its column's far
   edge so the row spans the whole measure — the same construction as the head
   of the home page's "Ready when you are" band.

   WHY THE HEAD IS LIGHT AND THE TERMS UNDER IT ARE NOT. The head is set at 300
   at display size — one thin statement across the top of the band — and the
   point titles under it sit at the body weight. That is the contrast the band
   is built on: the statement is light and wide, the terms under it are solid
   and small.

   THE LIST IS RULED TOP AND BOTTOM. Each point owns its top rule and the list
   owns the last one, so four points read as a stated set rather than as four
   loose paragraphs — and a fifth needs no change to the closing rule.

   THE RAILS STRETCH. align-items:stretch, and the figure is sized by the copy
   beside it — see .at-intro__figure — so the photograph runs to the same
   bottom line as the buttons however long the notes turn out to be.
   ========================================================================== */

   THE CHOOSER'S PANES HOLD ONE HEIGHT.

   The right-hand pane of each tab is an Elementor container with no height
   of its own on desktop: the tab row is a flex row, so the pane is as tall as
   the list beside it. Its blur bars are an absolutely positioned child
   anchored to the pane's foot and 340-390px tall (post-17.css, c645356 /
   4bec2ed / a43d0e7 and their children). On the home page every tab lists
   three items, the row is 480px and the bars fit. A tab with one item — Real
   Estate's three, Mortgages' "Business Property" — makes a 242px row, and the
   bars ran 150px above the pane's top edge, across the tab titles.

   Measured on /mortgages-services/ tab 2: pane 455 -> 697, bars from 307.

   So the pane gets the height the home page's rows come to, and clips. Every
   tab's pane is then the same size whatever it lists, which also stops the
   section changing height as the reader moves between tabs. Written at
   (0,5,0) to clear post-17's (0,3,0); above 1024 only, because below that the
   captured sheet stacks the pane under the list and gives it 60vh itself.

   THE BANNER — the reference card.

   One rounded card split down the middle: the brand ramp and three things on
   the left — a heading, a paragraph and a button — a plate on the right. That
   is the whole section, and it is drawn short and wide: anything that has to
   be said here has to fit a heading and about forty words, or the shape is
   gone.

   THE BUTTON IS PINNED, NOT SPACED. margin-top:auto on .at-prob__cta is what
   puts it on the panel's bottom edge with the gap opening above it. A margin
   instead would leave it floating under the paragraph at one card height and
   detached at another.

   THE SPLIT IS 50/50 AND HARD, by request — the ramp fills the left column,
   the plate fills the right, and the join is the column edge. IF A BLEND IS
   EVER WANTED BACK, feather the plate's left edge with a mask rather than
   painting a matching colour over it: --brand is a 150deg ramp, so the colour
   at the column edge changes down its height, and no single flat blue can
   match it; the first attempt at this card tried exactly that and the join
   showed as a faint vertical line.

/* ==========================================================================
   THE SERVICE STRIP — the sub-services, one open.

   A hover accordion: photographic panels side by side, one expanded and
   carrying its description, the rest collapsed to a title and a number. The
   first panel is the resting state, so the strip is never a row of anonymous
   slivers.

   IT IS CSS ONLY, and which panel is open is three selectors:

     .at-acc__panel:first-child                          resting
     .at-acc:hover .at-acc__panel:hover                   pointer
     .at-acc:focus-within .at-acc__panel:focus-visible    keyboard

   — plus two rules between them that close the first child the moment the
   strip is pointed at or tabbed into. ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING: those closing
   rules must sit between the resting rules and the opening ones, because the
   resting rule and the closing rule carry the same specificity and the later
   one has to win.

   THE GAP IS PADDING, NOT A FLEX GAP. A flex gap is dead space: crossing it makes
   .at-acc:hover true while no panel is hovered, every panel collapses, and the
   strip flickers on the way from one panel to the next. Here the gap is
   padding-right on the panel, so the hit areas are contiguous and the pointer
   is always inside exactly one of them.

   THE OPEN PANEL'S CARD HAS A FIXED WIDTH and is clipped by the panel it sits
   in. A percentage width would re-wrap its paragraph on every frame of the
   expansion; a fixed one simply slides out from behind the panel's edge.

   The count is whatever the service publishes — eight for Accounting & Tax,
   three for Real Estate — and nothing here is written to a number. --open is
   the open panel's share in closed panels, and 3.2 holds at both ends: at
   eight the closed ones are still a readable width, and at three the open one
   is still clearly the open one.

  /* ---- THE TIMING, IN ONE PLACE --------------------------------------
     --ease is a long deceleration (an ease-out quint): it leaves fast and
     lands slowly, which is what makes a width change read as a panel opening
     rather than as a layout jump.

     THE TWO DIRECTIONS ARE NOT THE SAME LENGTH. Every piece of content in here
     fades OUT quickly and with no delay, and fades IN slowly and after one.
     The fast, no-delay transition is the BASE rule, and the slow delayed one
     is set on the open-state rules only. A transition runs with the value the
     element has in the state it is moving TO, so an element gaining the open
     rule takes the slow curve and an element losing it falls back to the fast
     one. No JavaScript and no duplicate keyframes.

     The open sequence is deliberately staggered — panel, then card at .42s,
     then the link at .62s — so the three arrive in the order you read them.

     WHY IT IS ALSO CHEAPER THAN IT LOOKS. A flex-grow transition is layout
     work on every frame; the dim on a closed panel is an opacity-animated
     overlay (.at-acc__inner::after) rather than a filter on the photograph,
     and contain:layout paint stops a panel's repaint at its own edge.
     will-change on the image is applied only while the strip is engaged, so
     the photographs are not each holding a promoted layer at rest. */

              THE HOME PAGE'S SECTION, COPIED. Everything inside the
              <div data-elementor-id="17"> is the captured Elementor markup
              already running at / and at /our-group/valunxt-corporate-services/
              — same element ids, same structure, same tab widget — rendered
              from SOLUTION_IDS rather than written out three times.

              WHY IT IS COPIED AND NOT REBUILT. The tab behaviour is Elementor's
              nested-tabs widget, and elements-handlers.min.js — which every
              page already loads — is what switches the panels. Rebuilding the
              markup would mean rebuilding that too. The .elementor-17 wrapper
              is what lets post-17.css style it; see EXTRA_CSS in
              lib/uae-service-pages.ts for how these pages come to load it. */}

              too.

              The pane also takes flex-end here. The captured sheet spaces its
              children apart, which held the corner mark at the top and the
              button at the foot; the mark is gone (client instruction,
              20260911) and the button is the only child left, so without this
              it would rise to the top. */}
