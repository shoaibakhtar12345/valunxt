/**
 * What /en-ae/services/real-estate-transactions/ says.
 *
 * THE COPY IS THE CLIENT'S page document (20260911), word for word, on the
 * service template, under the same two rules as the home page: nothing added
 * to the document or dropped from it, and no em dashes anywhere on the UAE
 * pages. Three things this document says that the template had no field for
 * are fields now, on every page: a tab's own heading line, a tab's own items
 * and button, and which three related services show (see ../template/types.ts).
 *
 * Two of the document's sentences arrived with a dash already taken out and
 * nothing put in its place; a colon and a comma stand where it was, and both
 * are marked below. "Speak to anAdvisor" is read as "Speak to an Advisor".
 *
 * SUB-SERVICE SLUGS resolve through vxnServices('en-ae'), so every slug below
 * exists in that registry and the strip cannot point at a 404. The card names
 * are the document's ("Sell & Rent/Lease", "Off-Plan Properties"); the
 * registry still carries the older forms for the menu and the breadcrumbs
 * until those pages' documents arrive.
