   service page the six panels are that service's own disciplines, which is
   what makes the strip worth its full-bleed height here.

   SIX, because the row divides the viewport between however many it is given
   and six is what the home pages are tuned for. Artwork uses the same
   first-that-exists list as the home strip: drop a better file in at the first
   path and it takes over with no code change.
