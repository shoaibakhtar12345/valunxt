/**
 * What /en-ae/services/accounting-tax-services/ says.
 *
 * SOURCE — "VALUNXT ACCOUNTING & TAX SERVICES — FINAL DEVELOPMENT-READY PARENT
 * SERVICE PAGE" (20260905). The copy below is that document; nothing here is
 * written or embellished. Where the document gave both a long form and a short
 * card form of the same service, both are kept — the long form is the decision
 * tool's answer, the short form is the card.
 *
 * WHY THIS PAGE HAS ITS OWN CONTENT MODULE. The other five UAE services share
 * ServicePageBody and the five-section shape in ../content.ts. This one is a
 * fifteen-section commercial page with a comparison table, a decision table, a
 * pricing rail and twelve FAQs; expressing it through the shared template would
 * mean bending the template to fit one page and leaving the other five carrying
 * fields they never set.
 *
 * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. The document closes with a development instruction:
 * hero, proof, a short problem statement, then THE EIGHT SERVICE CARDS — "the
 * commercial centre of the page" — and "do not allow generic accounting
 * education to push the eight services down the page". The section order in
 * ServiceTemplateBody follows that, which is why the problem section is three
 * short blocks and not the essay the source could support.
 *
 * SUB-SERVICE LINKS resolve through vxnServices('en-ae'), so every `slug` below
 * exists in that registry and the eight cards cannot point at a 404.
