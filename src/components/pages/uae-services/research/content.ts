/**
 * What /en-ae/services/research-intelligence/ says.
 *
 * THE COPY IS THE CLIENT'S page document (20260911), word for word, on the
 * service template, under the same two rules as the home page: nothing added
 * to the document or dropped from it, and no em dashes anywhere on the UAE
 * pages. Three proof points, as the document gives; every tab has a button
 * of its own.
 *
 * This slug is the one both markets use; the UAE branch of the static route
 * at app/[region]/services/research-intelligence/ is what renders this.
 *
 * SUB-SERVICE SLUGS resolve through vxnServices('en-ae'), so every slug below
 * exists in that registry and the strip cannot point at a 404.
