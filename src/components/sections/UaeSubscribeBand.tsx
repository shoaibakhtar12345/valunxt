/**
 * The newsletter section on /en-ae/.
 *
 * Half brand gradient, half photograph, with a frosted bar overlapping the two
 * near the bottom — the label and the headline on the coloured half, the line
 * of copy and the email field on the bar.
 *
 * THE COPY IS THE CLIENT'S ONE SENTENCE (20260911), split across the slots the
 * layout gives it. The document reads "Stay Ahead With ValuNxt Insights —
 * perspectives on business, property, markets and the decisions shaping the
 * UAE.", and it is the same words here: the name is the label, what the list
 * covers is the headline, and the call is the line on the bar. Splitting at
 * the dash is also what removes it; the UAE pages carry no em dashes, by the
 * client's rule.
 *
 * THE INLINE FIELD IS BACK, by request. This section had dropped it so the page
 * carried one lead route; it now takes an email again and the button submits
 * rather than linking to /contact/.
 *
 * THE FIELD LIVES IN UaeSubscribeForm, a client component, because it has to
 * post itself — see the note there for why leaning on Elementor's form handler
 * did not work. This file stays a server component so it can keep resolving its
 * photograph through rimgFirst(), which reads the filesystem.
 *
 * Styles: assets/css/valunxt-landing.css (.vxn-sub).
