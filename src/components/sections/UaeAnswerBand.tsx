/**
 * "Valunxt Answer", the ask-and-answer band on /en-ae/ (20260911, restaged
 * 20260912, pared back the same day).
 *
 * The band began as a restaging of "BCG Answer", the promo on bcg.com's home
 * page, and was flagged as too close to it. It is now its own thing: the
 * stage sits on the LEFT, on the brand's dark pleated-blue artwork, and holds
 * a rail of the six questions (buttons, one lit and timed), an ask field
 * across the top and the answer card under it; the copy and the call to
 * action sit on the right. The measurements are in the stylesheet (section
 * 17 of assets/css/valunxt-landing.css) and the stage itself, with its
 * timeline and what the visitor can do with it, is UaeAnswerVisual.tsx. This
 * file is the section's copy and the six scenes the stage plays, one per
 * service.
 *
 * PARED BACK on client feedback: the first stage was cluttered. The answer
 * card carried a picture, a chip, a headline, the answer, a "Where to start"
 * label, three page links with thumbnails and the service link; it now
 * carries the picture, the chip, the headline, the answer and the one link,
 * and the rail lost its counter. The lede is one sentence. The motion (the
 * typing, the progress bar, the card sliding up) is what remains, with more
 * room around it.
 *
 * THE COPY IS NOT THE CLIENT'S. Every other band on this page carries the home
 * document word for word; this band was asked for after that document was
 * written, so its eyebrow, title, lede and button (rewritten 20260912 on
 * client feedback: "Valunxt Answer" went), the rail's "Pick a question"
 * label, the card's "Explore <service>" link and the six questions are
 * drafted here, in the document's register, to be replaced when the client
 * supplies theirs. Everything else the stage shows is the registry's: each
 * answer is the service's own accordion sentence, the card's title is the
 * service's headline and the picture is the service's own. No em dashes, as
 * on every UAE page: plain() turns any that reach it into a comma.
 *
 * WHERE IT SITS. After the six services and before the impact strip, because
 * every question it answers is one of theirs. India renders nothing of this.
