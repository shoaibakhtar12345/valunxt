/**
 * The bento on /en-ae/ (20260912; rebuilt the same day from the poster trio).
 *
 * Built to the reference supplied that afternoon: a two-row grid of four
 * cards on a three-column track, the top row a wide photograph beside a
 * narrow colour card, the bottom row a narrow dark card beside a wide pale
 * one. The reference's cards are a customer story with a serif quote over
 * the photograph, a "facts and numbers" card with one large figure, a dark
 * story card with a photograph along its foot, and a review card carrying a
 * serif line and two buttons. Each is kept as a shape and given this brand's
 * content and colours: the blue is the CTA ramp, the pale card is the site's
 * cream, the type is the market's one face, Sanomat Sans.
 *
 * THE FILE KEEPS ITS NAME AND ITS PREFIX. UaeBandMotion.tsx reveals
 * .vxn-post__card by selector and section 15 of the stylesheet lists
 * .vxn-post in the page rhythm; renaming either would mean touching both for
 * no gain. The glass plates and the sheen of the trio are gone with it: the
 * reference has neither.
 *
 * THE COPY IS NOT THE CLIENT'S, as the trio's was not: the three statements
 * are the trio's own, drafted in the home document's register, and the
 * figure is the client's 48+ years from the careers band's lede. The card
 * labels are drafted here. Every link leads to a page this site already
 * publishes. No em dashes, as on every UAE page.
 *
 * WHERE IT SITS. After the careers band and before the insights carousel.
 * India renders none of it.
 *
 * Motion: components/sections/UaeBandMotion.tsx. Styles:
 * assets/css/valunxt-landing.css (section 20, .vxn-post).
