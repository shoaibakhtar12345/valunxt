/**
 * The practices band on /en-ae/ (20260912, simplified the same day).
 *
 * Built to the reference supplied that day: one wide rounded card on a blue
 * gradient with flowing ribbons across it, a lead panel held apart on the left
 * and three points beside it with a hairline between each. The reference's
 * palette is not used; every surface here is the brand's own, and the ribbons
 * are homepage/abstract-2.webp, the artwork already in uploads that the
 * reference's background happens to be a near match for.
 *
 * NO FIGURES. The first build carried four numbers (six practices, 48+ years,
 * 200+ years combined, 10+ industries) rolled up on arrival. Rehman asked for
 * the number content to go and simple headings to take its place, at a smaller
 * size, so each cell is now a short heading over one line of prose and the
 * roll is gone. The three points still say what the three figures said, in
 * words; the numbers themselves remain in the band below ("Expertise Measured
 * in Decades."), which is client copy and was left alone.
 *
 * THE WORDING IS MINE, drafted in the home document's register, because the
 * document gives no caption for any of it. A slot to be replaced when the
 * client supplies copy. No em dashes, as on every UAE page.
 *
 * WHERE IT SITS. Straight after the "Who We Are" trio and before the six
 * services, so the proof is read before the offer. India renders none of it.
 *
 * Motion: components/sections/UaeBandMotion.tsx fades the panel and the three
 * points in once the card is on screen; nothing here depends on it.
 *
 * Styles: assets/css/valunxt-landing.css (section 19, .vxn-figs).
