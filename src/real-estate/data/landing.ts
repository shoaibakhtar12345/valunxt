/**
 * THE DUBAI LANDING PAGE'S CONTENT (20260921).
 *
 * Everything the page says and shows, in one file, so the page can be
 * re-worded and re-stocked without opening a component. Sections, in page
 * order: hero and search, the ticker, listings, why Dubai, areas, lifestyle,
 * the two calculators, the process, FAQs, the lead form's copy.
 *
 * WHAT IS INDICATIVE, AND SAID SO ON THE PAGE. The listings are curated
 * examples of the stock this desk handles, priced at current market bands —
 * not live inventory, and the page labels them "Featured, indicative". The
 * area price bands and yields are typical published market figures rounded
 * to a band, labelled indicative and dated. Replace LISTINGS with a feed and
 * AREAS' figures with the desk's own numbers when those are ready; nothing
 * else needs to change.

  { q: 'Can a foreign national own property in Dubai outright?', a: 'Yes. In the designated freehold areas — which include every community on this page — non-UAE nationals own the property and the land it stands on, in their own name or through a company, with no local partner and no time limit. Title is registered with the Dubai Land Department.' },
  { q: 'What does it cost to buy, beyond the price?', a: 'Budget around 6–7% on top of the purchase price: a 4% Dubai Land Department transfer fee, a fixed registration fee, and agency at 2%. On a mortgage there is a 0.25% registration fee and valuation costs. We put the full stack in writing before you make an offer.' },
  { q: 'How does the Golden Visa work with property?', a: 'Own property worth AED 2 million or more — a single unit or several, ready or off-plan from approved developers, and it can be mortgaged — and you qualify for a renewable ten-year residency for yourself, your spouse and your children. We prepare the application alongside the purchase.' },
  { q: 'Is off-plan safe?', a: 'Every off-plan payment goes into a RERA-regulated escrow account held for the specific project and released to the developer only against certified construction progress. We check the developer’s track record, the escrow status and the completion date before you commit, and the payment plan against your cash flow.' },
  { q: 'I do not live in the UAE. Can I buy, and can I get a mortgage?', a: 'Yes to both. Non-residents buy remotely with a power of attorney we arrange, and several UAE banks lend to non-residents — typically up to 50–60% of value. Our mortgage desk compares the offers side by side.' },
  { q: 'What return should I expect?', a: 'Gross yields across these communities typically run 5–8%, net of service charges roughly 1–2 points lower; the calculator above shows both for any price and rent. Capital growth has been strong but is not guaranteed, and we will say so — our own valuers write the appraisal, not the seller’s agent.' },
