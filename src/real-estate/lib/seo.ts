/**
 * Page metadata for the module, kept out of the route files.
 *
 * Standalone, this built its own hreflang pair for /ae-en/ and /ae-ar/. Inside
 * this site the module's pages are ordinary pages of the site, so they carry the
 * same tag set every other page carries — canonical against the request origin,
 * one hreflang alternate per published market plus x-default, Open Graph and
 * Twitter — assembled here from the site's own SEO helpers rather than from a
 * second, parallel implementation.
 *
 * The one thing they deliberately do NOT do is register in
 * src/data/page-configs.json. That registry is what the admin panel lists and
 * what the sitemap is generated from, and this section is published unlinked
 * for now: reachable by typing the URL, absent from the navigation and absent
 * from the sitemap. Add an entry there when the practice is ready to be
 * advertised, and the panel and the sitemap pick it up.
