 * The document shell.

 * `<html lang>`, `<body class>` and the whole `<head>` stylesheet block are all
 * per-page on this site — the lang comes from the visitor's edition, the body
 * class is the full WordPress class list the theme CSS keys off
 * (`body.elementor-page-264`, `body.responsive-layout`, …), and the Elementor
 * per-post stylesheets are listed by the page. Next.js only lets the root
 * layout render `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>`, so it resolves the current page
 * itself from the request path that proxy.ts publishes as `x-vxn-path`.
 *
 * Keeping HeadAssets here rather than in the page matters: includes/head.php
 * interleaved `<link>` and `<style>` (post-*.css comes after the global inline
 * styles; valunxt-brand.css after both), and that interleaving is the cascade.
 * Rendered inside the real <head>, the order is byte-for-byte what PHP emitted.
