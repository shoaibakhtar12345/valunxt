/**
 * A UAE service page — /en-ae/services/<service>/.
 *
 * The six UAE services are one dynamic route rather than six folders: they all
 * render the same three sections, and their names and URLs already live in
 * vxnServices('en-ae'). Adding a service is an entry in that registry, not a
 * new file here.
 *
 * India's four services keep their own static folders next to this one, each
 * with real content behind it. A static segment beats a dynamic one in Next's
 * matcher, so /en-in/services/capital-advisory/ still reaches its own page and
 * never falls through to this route — and the region guard below means this
 * route answers for the UAE only, so India cannot reach a UAE slug either.
 *
 * /services/research-intelligence/ is the one slug both markets use. Its static
 * folder wins for both, so the branch lives there; see that file.
